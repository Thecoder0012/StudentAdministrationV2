# Student Administration System v3

A spring boot application created without the JPA interface or preparedstatements. 
I have created the same Student Administration project three times with different tools.
This time I am using the JdbcTemplate which is a step above preparedstatements, but below the JPA interface.

A project created with:

- Spring Boot/Java/MySql (backend)
- HTML/CSS/Thymeleaf (frontend)
